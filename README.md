# Automated grocery shopping for E-Maxima.

Back in 2015, I was tired of spending time on online grocery shopping so I wrote a script
doing the job for me.

The script reads credentials from the password manager, logs into E-maxima online shop,
picks the cheapest/cheapest discounted items from the predefined categories.

This script saved me hours of life as I only needed to double check if I liked all the products from the list generated by the script and confirm the payment.
